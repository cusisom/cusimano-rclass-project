# Processing_code folder

This folder contains code for processing data.

It's the same code done twice.

Included is the Processing code in R as well as the .qmd file and rendered Quarto html. 

I utilized code chunks when writing my .qmd file. The code required to read in these chunks is viewable under # Setup in the .qmd file. Applications of this method can be found through the R environment by ?read_chunk().
