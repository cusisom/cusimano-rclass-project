# Processing_code folder

The material found in this folder details the work for Project 1. The goal of this project was to clean the data found in the penguins_raw_dirty file (Data/Raw_Data folder_). 



# Processing_code folder contents

This folder contains code for processing the penguins_raw_dirty data.

Included in this folder is the:
-Processing code in R (processingcode.R)
-The Quarto file for publishing the data cleaning process (processingfile_v2.qmd)
-The rendered Quarto .html file.

For a quick review of the data cleaning process, users are urged to follow the .html link

The .qmd file utilizes code chunks. To review the R analysis, users must refer to the .r script. The script details the input, edits made to the data, and output location. 

I utilized code chunks when writing my .qmd file. The code required to read in these chunks is viewable under # Setup in the .qmd file. Applications of this method can be found through the R environment by ?read_chunk().
