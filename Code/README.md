# Code Folder

There are two folders associated with Code. These correspond with the projects assigned in class. Project 1 focused on data cleaning. The code used to clean the penguins_raw_dirty file (found in the Data folder) can be found in the Processing_code folder. Project 2 focuses on data analysis. The code used for this assignment will be found in the Analysis_code folder. 

Users exploring this data are encouraged to follow the structure of the assignment by reviewing the Project 1 material before that of Project 2.
