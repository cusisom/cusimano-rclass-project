# Code Folder

There are two folders associated with Code. These correspond with the projects assigned in class. Project 1 focused on data cleaning. The code used to clean the penguins_raw_dirty file (found in the Data folder) can be found in the Processing_code folder. Project 2 focuses on data analysis. The code used for this assignment will be found in the Analysis_code folder. 

Users exploring this data are encouraged to follow the structure of the assignment by reviewing the Project 1 material before that of Project 2. 

## Code Design:

You can either have fewer large scripts, or multiple scripts that do only specific actions. Those can be R scripts or qmd files. In either case, document the scripts and what goes on in them so well that someone else (including future you) can easily figure out what is happening.

The scripts should load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders. 

Be sure to use **relative paths** so that each script works from the working directory set to the folder that the script is in. 

## Required Documentation:

-  What inputs each script takes and where output is placed. 
-  If scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this. 
-  Documentation could be either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this readme file. Ideally of course in both locations, especially for more complex projects.
