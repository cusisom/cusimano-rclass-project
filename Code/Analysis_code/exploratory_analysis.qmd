This is going to be a working process that will ultimately trim a lot of fat along the way (including this explanation). The goal is for me to set up the webpage with the needed stats and images and then to edit by adding text content and removing the template content. 
  
All of the original content will be below my workstream until I am ready to remove it. 
  
This Quarto file loads the cleaned Palmer Penguins data and does some initial analysis. I find this step very helpful for seeing what results you have to work with for your talk or paper/final report. 

Some of what is written below is for you. I would like you to modify this quarto file to produce a document customized for your analysis and written to explain your thinking in your data analysis so feel free to modify as much as you wish. 

It is worth taking a minute to reflect on where we are in the data analysis workflow. The purpose of the previous processing document was to document data cleaning and processing in preparation for analysis. You saw that as part of the cleaning and processing step, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you find more things that need cleaning. As you clean, you find more to explore. 

# The need to document your workflow

Although we broke our workflow in this project into cleaning and analysis steps, depending on your project, it may be more logical to divide the scripts in other ways. The organization should naturally reflect the workflow. 

In rather clean datasets at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. _But if you do have real errors to fix, you will want to carefully document cleaning steps_, and probably not redo the cleaning each time you want to get a bit further on your data exploration and analysis. Itʻs a lot of baggage to carry around and also errors might creep in if you are keeping code in your script that you are not actively working on. 

When there are natural breaks in the workflow (i.e., when you close the door on cleaning or on a first analysis), it can be a good idea to have start a new script because once you clean your data, you will have a new starting point for all of your downstream analyses (and not look back at the really raw data, unless you want to change your mind about some of the cleaning - thus the need for keeping an original raw data file and documenting all the steps).  

This can also come up when you have a multi-stage analysis. In very complex analyses, it can make a lot of sense to have separate scripts for major analyses or workflow steps. As always, use your jugement, and be intentional about your organization. Clean organization = clear thinking.  


# Analysis 

If you did a good job in the previous step, you should have a pretty good idea of the structure of the data. 

For this part of the project, develop three questions and use your R skills to answer them. Begin by producing a summary table of the data that could be included in a future paper. You should produce plots or tables and/or statistics or model fits to address your questions. 

# Setup

The setup has mostly remained the same except that I am adding dplyr and various new files paths

```{r }
#| cache = FALSE
knitr::read_chunk('analysiscode.R')
```

Load needed packages and filepaths.  

```{r setup}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
```

Load custom functions. I haven't messed with this mostly because I don't fully understand it. 

```{r functions}
```

Load the data.

```{r loaddata}
```

# Create a summary table

In any paper you should always report a summary of the data. This includes basic statsistics for your data including sample size, counts, and means and standard errors for continuous data. 

Here we will use skimr which produces a summary table, but with more than we want. Letʻs save it as an object so we can grab the elements we want. 

It turns out that the `skim()` function returns a tibble. We can coerce it to a dataframe and use `head()` to see what the column names are and what the data look like. 

```{r, summarize}
```

## Select columns for a final summary table

Letʻs retain only the variable, N, mean, sd, and category counts, but letʻs rename them. Since we will use the SD to compute the stadard error letʻs just rename it as SE now and save a step later.  (Remember the standard error is just the standard deviation/ square root(sample size)). 

Note: The `results="asis"` is an option for `knitr` to layout the the results without the code formatting. Normally output from code chunks has the look of R output. `"asis"` (as in "as is", lol) removes that behavior, so we can lay it out as a typeset table for print. 

```{r summary.table, results="asis"}
```


# Body Mass Distribution
## Interspecific and Intraspecific Varition

I am first interested in the size distribution of the Palmer Penguins. I begin by examining the Interspecific variation in Body Mass. 


```{r, Dimorphism1}
```
I chose to change this to a violin plot to get a clearer illustration of size distribution. 

```{r, Dimorphism2}
```

I like this plot. It illustrates that Adelie and Gentoo penguins have a wider range in Body Mass than do Chinstrap Penguins.

My question is whether these wider ranges in Body Mass reflect stronger Sexual Size Dimorphism in Adelie and Gentoo Penguins than in Chinstrap Penguins. Thus, I set up a plot that differentiates by Species and Sex.

First I need to remove the NA values. 

```{r, subsetting1}
```

Now I can plot. 

```{r, Dimorphism4}
```

The plot shows clear dimorphism with Gentoo Penguins. It also illustrates stronger dimorphism in Adelie than Chinstrap populations but it is more subtle.

## Analysis of Sexual Size Dimorphism


To get a better idea of this discrepancy in Body Mass, I want to test the degree of sexual size dimorphism statistically. The goals here are to 1) illustrate that each of these three penguin species is Sexually Dimorphic in Body Mass and 2) illustrate the relatively lower degree of dimorphism in the Chinstrap penguins. This second point will support the idea of the narrower body mass distribution in Chinstrap penguins reflecting reduced sexual size dimorphism. While this point might be self-evident, it is still interesting to note the correlation between sexual size dimorphism within a species and overall range in body mass.

To support my hypotheses,I first illustrate summary data on the differences in Body Mass and then test the significance of this difference with a Welch's T-test. I replicate this process for each species.

### Adelie Penguins

For the Adelie Penguins I first subset the species and remove NA values. 

#### Summary

```{r, Adelie_T-test1}
```

#### T-test
To test the means of each population (Male and Female) I need to filter the population into individual vectors. From there I can test the means through a t-test. 

```{r, Adelie_T-test2}
```

The p-value supports the significance of Sexual Size Dimorphism in Adelie Penguins. I will pay attention to the t-value (-13.126) for comparison with the other species'. 

### Gentoo Penguins 

As noted above, the Gentoo penguins are subjected to the same round of tests as the Adelie penguins. 

#### Summary

```{r, Gentoo_T-test1}
```
#### T-test

```{r, Gentoo_T-test2}
```

Just as above, the p-value corroborates the violin plot distribution for Secual Size Dimorphism. The t-value here is greater than that of Adelie (-14.638).

*(I suggest that the value is greater despite the number actually being smaller. I have very little background in statistics but, from what I have gathered, negative and positive values do not weigh on the interpretation of t-values).* 

### Chinstrap Penguins

The final round of tests is run on the Chinstrap Penguins. Wy assumption is that both the p- and t- values will be smaller than those of the other two species. 

#### Summary

```{r, Chinstrap_T-test1}
```

It's looking like a much narrower size difference.

```{r, Chinstrap_T-test2}
```

### Sexual Size Dimorphism Conclusions

It looks like the data supports my assumptions. The Chinstrap Penguins present much differently than the other species in terms of Sexual Dimorphism. Both the p- and t- values noticebly differed. I wanted to test the statistical difference between the t-test results, but I am not sure how to do that and I am too short on time for this assignment to figure it out. 

# Differentiating between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins on Dream Island

Despite the differences in sexual dimorphism, the Chinstrap and Adelie Penguins seem to cluster closely in Body Mass. With their geographic overlap on Dream island, my next question concerns the morphological distinction between the two species. I wonder if, with the current available data, I can see the justification for differentiating the two populations as different species. 

In examining photos of the two birds, the phenotypic differences are distinct. As a paleontologists, however, I do not often have the ability to examine soft tissue (including feathers). Thus, for my own purposes, I'd like to see just how vague physical measurements can be in phylogenitic pursuits. I will acknowledge here that the measurements provided to us here were taken from specimens in the flesh, and so the results of this inquiry will not directly translate to my interests, but it is a starting point.

## Bivariate Plots

As we did in the first part of the project, I begin testing this question by plotting the different morphological data I am given against Body Mass. This time around, however, I specify the species and island of interest. I mightloosen the geographic constraints as I progress but it seems best to start with where the occur sympatrically. 

I Begin this process by removing Gentoo Penguins from the analysis. The additional morphological data includes Culmen Length, Culmen Depth, and Flipper Length. 


```{r, nogentoo}
```
Before plotting each variable, I wanted to get a broad graphical look at the interspecific variation in the variables I hadn't yet tested. 

This task was accomplished by installing the GGally package 

```{r, Ad~Cs1}
```
