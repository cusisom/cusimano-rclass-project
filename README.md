# Overview

I am intentionally keeping most of the original content in here until the project is completed. 


# History

2023-02-16 First release with Data and Code folders with materials for data cleaning and initial exploration.

# Acknowledgement

 This template was cloned and modified from <https://github.com/andreashandel/dataanalysis-template>
 

# Software requirements

This template lays out a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx if you wish to use that format (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).

# Template content


Please see the `README.md` files in each folder for more details.

* This template has been populated with _Palmer Penguins_ morphology and life history data in the `Raw_data` folder. 
* The `Processing_code` folder contains several files that load the raw data, perform a bit of cleaning, and save the result in the `Processed_data` folder. 
* The `Analysis_code` folder contains several files that load the processed data, do an exploratory analysis, and fit a simple model. These files produce figures and some numeric output (tables), which are saved to the `results` folder.
* The `Products` folder contains an example `bibtex` and CSL style files for references. Those files are used by the example manuscript and slides.
* The  `Manuscript` folder contains a template for a report written as Quarto file. There is also a sub-folder containing an example template for a supplementary material file as is common in scientific articles these days.
* The `slides` folder contains a basic example of slides made with Quarto.
