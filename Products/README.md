# Products

This folder is used for dissemination files. 

## Content

I am currently only generating a manuscript file for dissemination. Previous to my edits, this folder also contained a subfolder for slides, which I think is a good idea. I am only mentioning it as a reference to me in the future. 

I also like the idea of have a `Supplementary Information` folder, as I can see using this in future works.

Given the scope of this assignment and my slow progress on it, I stuck with the single out file for Products. That single file is found in the `Maunscript` folder
